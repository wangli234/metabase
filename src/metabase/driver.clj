  "Metabase Drivers handle various things we need to do with connected data warehouse databases, including things like
  introspecting their schemas and processing and running MBQL queries. Each Metabase driver lives in a namespace like
  `metabase.driver.<driver>`, e.g. `metabase.driver.postgres`. Each driver must implement the `IDriver` protocol
  below.

  JDBC-based drivers for SQL databases can use the 'Generic SQL' driver which acts as a sort of base class and
  implements most of this protocol. Instead, those drivers should implement the `ISQLDriver` protocol which can be
  found in `metabase.driver.generic-sql`.

  This namespace also contains various other functions for fetching drivers, testing database connections, and the
  like."
